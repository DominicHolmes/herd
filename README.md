# herd

a small demo of a sheep-herding game. used as an opportunity to try out the LOVE2D engine for Lua & play with the "boids" flocking algorithm

sheep naturally flock according to a few influences:
- an attractive force toward the center of the flock
- a repulsive force to keep them separate from walls and each other
- a "conformity" force where they try to match each other's velocities

the algorithm & LOVE work great, but the concept isn't very fun, so i'm leaving it here for now
